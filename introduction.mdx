<Callout kind="info">
  Primary brand color: `{`#3B82F6`}` (Blue-500). Use it for headers, buttons, and accents.
</Callout>

Here's how to apply it in CSS:

<CodeGroup tabs="CSS,Tailwind">
  ```css
  :root {
    --brand-color: #3B82F6;
  }

  .header {
    background-color: var(--brand-color);
    color: white;
  }
  ```
  ```html
  <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4 rounded-lg">
    Branded Header
  </div>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Avoid using it for text to ensure readability. Pair with neutral grays for best results.
